Symbulation is an agent-based model to explore the evolution of mutualism between a host species and a (currently) obligate endosymbiont species. mixed.cc is the latest version with fixed vertical transmission rate. vert_trans_evolve.cp is the current version with evolvable vertical transmission rate. C++11 is required to build.
