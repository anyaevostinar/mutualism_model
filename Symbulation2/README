Symbulation is an agent-based model to explore the evolution of mutualism between a host species and a (currently) obligate endosymbiont species. mixed.cc is the latest version with fixed vertical transmission rate. vert_trans_evolve.cp is the current version with evolvable vertical transmission rate. C++11 is required to build.

The command line arguments are
 [random number seed - int] 
[mutation rate, the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero that is used to add to the current number of a mutating organism - float 0.002 is recommended] 
[multiplier, the synergy effect applied to resources processed by the symbiont and returned to the host - int > 1]
Optional: if you are using mixed.cpp instead of vert_trans_evolve.cpp, you can also set the vertical transmission rate, float 0.0 - 1.0

tasks.cpp is the current development where more tasks/resources are added and the host and symbiont can only perform some of them
